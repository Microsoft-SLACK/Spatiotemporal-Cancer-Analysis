Today was a family get together for my daddy's 76th birthday. My dad is still doing good for having cancer. #lovepic.twitter.com/vLI71CWf9U,7
How does someone deal with a loved one having cancer? It's been bothering me and stressing me out big time. I just don't understand.,7

I've been going thru a lot of emotions lately. My father acts like he just wants to give up. This cancer thing that he has is getting to him,6
Feeling emotional off n on today. My father is getting weaker n weaker cuz of the cancer. I just don't wanna lose my father. I love him.,6

No one knows how long my dad has had this cancer before his doctor noticed that he did have it and it took 6 mths for them to do anything.,5
I've always been close to my father/dad since i was a little girl and now he's fighting this cancer he has. He served our country.,5
My father which has cancer isn't doing so good. Two times he's had cramping in his legs and chest pains. It could lead to a heart attack.,5
Don't know how much more i can take of deaths and this cancer crap. It tears me apart big time. I just know they aren't suffering.,5
Last month of April has been hard for me to deal with. My friends mom and my aunt passing away then my dad has cancer.,5

My dad came home 2 days ago on Friday. He has 2 stages of cancer. Lung and colon. The doctors want to do a biopsy on it to see how to treat.,5
I hate this cancer crap. I've been losing friends and ppl i know from it. And now my dad. I don't wanna lose him. #feelingemotional,4
At 8 am today my dads doctors in S.F. are supposed to do a biopsy and tests on his lung to see how bad the cancer is. I will keep u updated.,4
Please keep my dad in prayers. I found out that he has lung cancer. He's in San Francisco at the VA hospital getting tests done. Thanks,4

When my dad told me he had cancer I cried. I knew he wouldn't be here much longer. Watching him suffer was hard on me. I love my dad.,11
